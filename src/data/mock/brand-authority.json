      "AMARISÉ was born from a quiet rebellion—a belief that true luxury exists not in logos or excess, but in the ritual of thoughtful living.",
      "After two decades within the ateliers of Paris and Milan, I founded AMARISÉ in 2019 with a singular vision: to create objects worthy of becoming part of your story.",
      "Each piece we craft represents a conversation between heritage and innovation, between the maker's hand and the wearer's life. We do not chase trends. We pursue permanence.",
      "The name AMARISÉ—from the French 'amarrer,' to moor or anchor—reflects our philosophy. In a world of constant motion, we create anchors of beauty and meaning."
    ],
    "philosophy": "I believe the future of luxury is not more, but better. Not louder, but more resonant. Not faster, but more intentional."
